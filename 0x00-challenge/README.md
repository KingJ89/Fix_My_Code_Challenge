0-fizzbuzz.py
    We first check for multiples of both three and five (i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0) and append "FizzBuzz" accordingly.
    Then, we check for multiples of three (i % 3 == 0) and append "Fizz".
    Next, we check for multiples of five (i % 5 == 0) and append "Buzz".
    Finally, if none of the above conditions are met, we append the number itself as a string representation.
